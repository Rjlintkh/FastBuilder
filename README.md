A bridging server that looks like McPlayHD.net's

Have you ever ecnountered high ms of ping on McPlayHD.net, blocks disappearing, or timer lagging? This project allows you to host a bridging server with your own computer, which makes the laternacy much much lower and faster.

This is my first Java project so it might not be good and I did this in a hurry cuz I still have exams these days.

#### Features
* Normal mode
* Infinite blocks
* One player only
(~~lazy to make it multiplayer~~ for the sake of making less lag)
* CPS counter in action bar
* Distance counter in side bar
* Personal best and session best saved in fb_data.yml

#### Planned Features
* Short, one stack and inclined modes will be added respectively
* Infinity mode
* A setting to set the distance (won't make this by now)
* A setting to set the spawn point
* Auto aim position at spawn (for god bridging, moonwalking, etc.)
* Block selections and other customizations

#### Known Bugs
* Side bar flickering
* Player will be teleported twice after stepping on the finish line
* RMB cps counter will not count your clicks if you don't hold anything and click at air, this is a client side issue
* You cannot do TAS on this unless you make this into a forge server and install those mods on this (not tested)

#### Credits
* Stack Overflow
* Bukkit and Spigot communities

**NOTE:**
*There is no connection between this project and McPlayHD.net*
*Do not use this project to host public servers or redistribute without permissions*
